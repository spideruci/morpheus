# About...

## the project:

**The goal** of the project is help developers gain a better understanding of their test suite by:

1. providing insight into the structure of the test suite, and
2. create bidirectional traceability between test and production code.

The infrastructure consists of multiple componenets:
- **The visualization**: A matrix the developer can search/filter to show relationships between the executed tests and what was being executed.
- **Tacoco**: A test runner that allows instrumenting individual test cases, making it possible to get dynamic information for each individual test case.
- **Container-Runner**: A tool that runs the experiment for each project in their own environment allowing use to reproduce the results more easily.
- **SpiderTools**: Converts the coverage data from *tacoco* into method coverage and creates a mapping between test and production code including historical data.

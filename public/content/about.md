# About...

## the project:

**The goal** of the project is help developers gain a better understanding of their test suite by:

1. providing insight into the structure of the test suite, and
2. create bidirectional traceability between tests and the executed code.

The infrastructure consists of two components:
- **Morpheus**: A test matrix visualization allowing developers to explore the relationships between the executed tests and what they cover.
- **spidertools**: Converts the coverage data from *tacoco* into method coverage and creates a mapping between test and production code including historical data.
